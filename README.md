This project is a Drupal-based implementation of a responsive design with tab-based navigation and carousel sliders, developed according to the given design guidelines (PSD and video references).

Key Features
Responsive Design: The project is fully mobile-responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
Tabs with Carousel Sliders: Each tab contains a functional carousel slider with hover animations, built using custom JavaScript and the Slick.js library.
Pixel-Perfect Implementation: All design elements and animations are pixel-perfect, matching the provided PSD and sample video.
Graceful Handling of Missing Images: The carousel gracefully displays the image title when an image is missing, ensuring the layout remains intact.
Instructions Followed
1. Drupal Standards
This project adheres to all Drupal standards. It was built with custom themes and JavaScript, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

2. Pixel-Perfect Design
The design is pixel-perfect and replicates all visual elements, animations, and transitions as shown in the provided PSD and video.

3. Mobile Responsiveness
I have ensured the design adapts smoothly to various screen sizes, from large desktops to small mobile devices, without any visual breakage.

4. Tabs with Arrow Indicators and Carousel Slider
The project includes three tabs, each containing its own carousel slider. The following features have been implemented:

The active tabâ€™s font size increases, and an arrow appears below it, as demonstrated in the video.
The carousel slider smoothly transitions between items.
5. Hover State Animations for Carousel Items
Each carousel item has the following hover effects:

The image zooms in.
Additional information (such as text) slides up from the bottom. These animations match the sample video for a polished user experience.
6. Handling Missing Images
If an image is missing from the carousel, the design remains unaffected. In such cases, the title of the image is displayed as per the second item's behavior in the video.

7. Use of Front-End Framework
I have utilized the Bootstrap framework for structuring the layout and ensuring responsiveness. This was done while maintaining compatibility with Drupal's core theming system.

8. Custom JavaScript for Tabs and Sliders
Tabs and sliders were built from scratch using jQuery and Slick.js. No Drupal-contributed modules were used to meet the requirement of custom-built functionality.

9. Version Control with Git
The project is maintained in this Git repository, with a clean commit history and organized folder structure that aligns with Drupal's best practices. Each commit has a meaningful message explaining the changes made.

10. CSS Preprocessing with SASS
The project uses SASS as a CSS preprocessor, which ensures clean and scalable CSS code. This allows the use of variables, nesting, and reusable styles to keep the codebase maintainable.


Conclusion
This project fulfills all the specified requirements while adhering to Drupal standards, using custom JavaScript for tabs and sliders, and ensuring pixel-perfect responsiveness across all devices.
